## Sections Covered (1â€“30)

### **Section 1: Basics (Examples 1â€“5)**

* Replace the first occurrence of text in a line  
* Replace specific words (case sensitive)  
* Replace only the first match per line  
* Replace all matches in each line  

### **Section 2: More Replacements (Examples 6â€“10)**

* Replace only the 2nd or 3rd occurrence of a word in a line  
* Replace words only on a specific line  
* Replace within a range of lines  
* Replace on odd-numbered lines  

### **Section 3: Deleting Lines (Examples 11â€“15)**

* Delete a specific line (first, second, last)  
* Delete a range of lines  
* Delete lines matching a pattern  

### **Section 4: Printing (Examples 16â€“20)**

> By default, `sed` prints every line after applying edits.  
> Using **`-n`** suppresses this, so we can explicitly print lines with `p`.

* Print only a specific line (first, second, last)  
* Print a range of lines  
* Print lines matching a given pattern  

### **Section 5: Insert / Append / Change (Examples 21â€“25)**

* Insert a line before a given line  
* Append a line after a given line  
* Change (replace) a line completely  
* Insert a header at the start of the file  
* Append a footer at the end of the file  

### **Section 6: In-place Editing & Multiple Commands (Examples 26â€“30)**

> * **`-i`** â†’ edit files in place (optionally with a backup).  
> * **`-e`** â†’ run multiple sed commands in a single invocation.

* In-place replacement with backup  
* In-place deletion without backup  
* Use `-e` to combine replacement and deletion  
* Use `-e` to chain insertion and replacement  
* Restore file from backup
